# 🏡 Home SOC Lab – Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Home Security Operations Center (SOC) Lab**!  
This repository documents my week-by-week journey from **Infrastructure Engineer → Security Analyst → Future Security Architect**.  

The goal of this project is to:  
- Build a hands-on cybersecurity homelab.  
- Practice and document security fundamentals (networking, hardening, detection, response).  
- Showcase my growth and technical skills to future employers.
